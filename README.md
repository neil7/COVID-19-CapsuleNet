# COVID-19-CapsuleNet
Implementation of Capsule Network model on COVID-19 dataset to predict the infected patients from their Chest X-ray images

Steps to train the model -
1.	Download the dataset folder
2.	Run preprocess.ipynb script for generating training data - numpy arrays
3.	Run covid-19.ipynb to train and test the model

Future Steps - To add more data in the dataset, to collect more X-ray images of the COVID-19 positive patients
